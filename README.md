## Answers to the Code Challenge provided by Blinds.com

### Retrospective 

Here are a few of my take aways from this challenge
	- Better planning makes for a better coding process.
	- Writing the test before actually building the react components would make testing more valuable. 
	- Building an MVP first vs. refactoring while building a working model will speed up production time.
	- I still have a lot to learn

### Feedback on Challenge

Initially when I reviewed the code challenge, I was super intimidated by the task because:

- The topic was foreign to me.
- I do not think in C and therefore found it difficult to translate the task. 

But I am glad that I was able to complete the test because I was able to flex my react skills.
