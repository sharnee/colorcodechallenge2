## Answers to the Code Challenge provided by Blinds.com

### Retrospective 

Here are a few of my take aways from this challenge
	- Better planning makes for a better coding process.
	- Writing the test before actually building the react components would make testing more valuable. 
	- Building an MVP first vs. refactoring while building a working model will speed up production time.
